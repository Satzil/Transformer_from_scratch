<h1 id="implement-transformers-from-scratch">Implement Transformers from Scratch</h1>
<p>An implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch using Python and PyTorch.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains a complete implementation of the Transformer architecture, one of the state-of-the-art models for various natural language processing tasks. The implementation is done from scratch, providing a detailed understanding of the inner workings of Transformers.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Transformers have revolutionized NLP tasks by overcoming the limitations of traditional recurrent and convolutional neural networks. Their ability to capture long-range dependencies and parallelize computation has led to state-of-the-art performance in various tasks such as language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. However, understanding and implementing Transformers can be challenging due to their complex architecture. This project aims to demystify Transformers by providing a clear, step-by-step implementation from scratch.</p>

The architecture of the “Implement Transformers from Scratch” project involves several key components that work together to build and train a Transformer model for natural language processing tasks. Here’s an overview of the project architecture:</p>
<h3 id="transformer-model">1. Transformer Model</h3>
<p>The core of the architecture is the Transformer model itself, consisting of an encoder and a decoder. Each of these components contains multiple layers of attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Encoder:</strong> Accepts an input sequence of tokens and processes it through multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward networks. Each layer in the encoder independently processes the input sequence in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decoder:</strong> Takes the output of the encoder and generates an output sequence one token at a time. Like the encoder, the decoder consists of multiple layers of attention mechanisms and feedforward networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attention-mechanisms">2. Attention Mechanisms</h3>
<p>Attention mechanisms are essential components of the Transformer architecture, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Attention Mechanism:</strong> Calculates attention scores between all pairs of tokens in the input sequence, allowing each token to attend to all other tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Head Attention:</strong> Enhances the self-attention mechanism by performing multiple attention calculations in parallel, each focusing on different aspects of the input sequence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="positional-encoding">3. Positional Encoding</h3>
<p>Since Transformers lack sequential information, positional encoding is added to provide information about the position of tokens in the input sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positional Encoding:</strong> Generates embeddings that capture the position of tokens in the input sequence. These embeddings are added to the token embeddings before feeding them into the model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feedforward-networks">4. Feedforward Networks</h3>
<p>Feedforward neural networks are used within the Transformer model to process information from the attention mechanisms and positional encodings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feedforward Networks:</strong> Each layer in the Transformer model contains a feedforward neural network that applies non-linear transformations to the output of the attention mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
